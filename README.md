# How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Maintainability?

#ANSWER:

- ✅ **Static Typing**: Catches errors at compile-time instead of runtime.
- ✅ **IntelliSense Support**: Improves developer productivity with auto-complete and documentation.
- ✅ **Clear Contracts**: Interfaces and types make code more readable and self-documenting.
- ✅ **Refactoring Safety**: Easier and safer to rename, move, or change code structure.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Makes large codebases easier to manage and collaborate on.

TypeScript reduces bugs, improves readability, and makes long-term maintenance easier.
